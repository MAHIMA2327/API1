Mahavira was born into Jnatra clan of the Ikshvaku dynasty as the son of King Siddhartha of Kundagrama and 
Queen Trishala. During her pregnancy, Trishala was believed to have 16 auspicious dreams, all signifying the
coming of a great soul. Shwetamber Sect of Jainism believes that the mother saw 16 and Digambara sect believes
mother saw sixteen dreams which were interpreted by the King Siddhartha.[6] It is said that when Queen Trishala 
gave birth to Mahavira, Indra, the head of heavenly beings (devas) performed a ritual called abhisheka on Sumeru Parvat, this being
the second of five auspicious events (Panch Kalyanakas), said to occur in the life of all Tirthankaras.[7]
